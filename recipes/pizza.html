<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Feast your eyes on a classic, handcrafted pepperoni pizza, fresh from the oven with a golden-brown crust that's crispy on the outside and delightfully chewy within. The vibrant tomato sauce lays a tangy foundation, generously smothered with molten mozzarella cheese that stretches with every slice. Topping this cheesy canvas, you'll find an ample scattering of spicy pepperoni, their edges charmingly curled and crisped from the heat. Interspersed among the meaty rounds are bites of sweet green bell pepper and slivers of red onion, offering a crunch that contrasts the softness of the dough. A final sprinkle of Italian seasoning adds an aromatic touch to this timeless culinary masterpiece.</p>
